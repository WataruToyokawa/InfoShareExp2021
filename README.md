# Selective information sharing in risky bandit task (November/December 2021)

## Sample size

A group of 3 * 10 groups = 30 people

## Task

A two-armed bandit task (one risky one safe) with the following 2 * 2 different task setups:

Skewness (positively / negatively skewed) * risk premium (positive / negative) 

The task is a 60-trial 2-armed bandit. Between the 25th and 26th trial an environmental change is introduced so that risk premium is reversed within the same skewness domain. The group size is somewhere between 3 and 5 (i.e., 4 on average).

Each trial starts with the choice stage where subjects have to choose one of the two options to obtain a payoff. This payoff information is private.

However, each player has an opportunity to decide whether they share their payoff information. If they opt-in, the information of the payoff will be shown in the next choice stage. No social/public information is available otherwise. To share the payoff information, however, there is a wee cost incurred by the sharer's group (not sharer himself, as we don't want any social dilemma structures). The amount of the cost will be small (i.e. the cost is 50 points while the average payoff will be like 200 points).
