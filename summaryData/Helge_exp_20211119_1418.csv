The task was interesting, I started by clicking machine 1 and 2, and it became clear that 1 was a higher payout so I then stuck with that, however every now and then it went to a 0 payout. I still think overall it would have paid out more. I didn't choose to share my results as I guessed other would work it out for themselves."
